LevelingCore is a powerful and flexible leveling system built for server owners who want to bring an RPG like leveling system to their Hytale servers.

Servers can choose between multiple leveling formulas, including exponential, linear, table-based (CSV format), and fully custom mathematical expressions, allowing progression to be tuned precisely to the server’s design goals.

LevelingCore supports multiple database backends via JDBC, including H2, MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL, making it suitable for both local and distributed environments. XP and level data is stored safely and efficiently, with configurable connection pooling for high-traffic servers.

Included in LevelingCore is also XP migration, which automatically recalculates stored XP when the leveling formula changes, ensuring that player levels are preserved even as progression rules evolve.
